"""Game of Legion
6 dice sides: M D C L X V

Scores:
1x X V = value
3x L C D M = value
6 of a kind = 5000 (Legion)
One of each = 1665 (Circus)
3 pairs = 1000 (Domus) (includes four of a kind plus a pair)

Player rolls - select scoring combination to stage. if any dice left over, player may choose to continue rolling or bank current staged amount. if all six dice score, player *must* roll all again (retaining staged score). On a non-scoring roll, player's turn ends and staged value is lost.
First player to exceed a score of 5000 wins
